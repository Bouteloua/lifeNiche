      <h1>Lifemapper Client Library</h1>
      <p>
         The Lifemapper client library is a group of Python modules that allow
         you to access the Lifemapper web services.  These functions abstract
         the details of the requests and responses so that they can be used in
         a framework that is familiar to the developer.
      </p>

      <p>
         The "LMClient" class is the class you will instantiate when using the
         Lifemapper web services.  It is really just a container that handles 
         authentication and houses Lifemapper service groups such as Species
         Distribution Modeling services (SDM) and Range and Diversity (RAD).
         Documentation about each service group can be found on their 
         respective pages.  The client takes an optional user name and password
         on construction that allows you to log into a specific Lifemapper user
         account to use for interacting with the Lifemapper web services.<br />
         <br />
         Example: Instantiate the Lifemapper client using the anonymous user
         account
         <code>
            >>> cl = LMClient()
                 --- do stuff ---
            >>> cl.logout()
         </code>
         <br />
         Example: Instantiate the Lifemapper client using user credentials
         <code>
            >>> cl = LMClient(userId='someUser', pwd='someUserPassword')
                 --- do stuff ---
            >>> cl.logout()
         </code>
      </p>

      <a id="OutOfDateException"><h1>Client out of date exception</h1></a>
      <p>
         The "OutOfDateException" exception is thrown when the version of the 
         Lifemapper client library you are using becomes out of date and is no
         longer compatible with the current version of the Lifemapper web 
         services.  When a new version of the client library is released, you 
         will begin to receive warnings that you do not have the most 
         up-to-date version.  This exception will only be thrown when the 
         version of the client you have is no longer usable and you will need
         to update.
